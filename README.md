## DSA with javascript

-   Expect the array to be sorted always
-   Some solutons could have multipe commented code (different solutions to the same problem)

# Problems solved so far

-   Anagrams (compare two input strings and check if they are same or not)
-   Array comparison (compare two input arrays and check if they have same values)
-   Count unique value (from the array count all the unique values in the array)
-   Sum Zero (from the array get the first pair of numer whose sum is 0 )
