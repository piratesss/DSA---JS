## DSA with javascript

-   Expect the array to be sorted always
-   Some solutons could have multipe commented code (different solutions to the same problem)

# Problems solved so far

-   Anagrams (compare two input strings and check if they are same or not)
-   Array comparison (compare two input arrays and check if they have same values)
-   Count unique value (from the array count all the unique values in the array)
-   Frequency counter (follows the principle of anagram problem but the you input numbers instead of string as arguments)
-   Max sum of sub arrays from the given number length (two arguments are passed array and number, number denotes the maximum
    possible value of the sum of array based on the number length)
-   Sum Zero (from the array get the first pair of numer whose sum is 0 )
-   Average Pair (take an array and a value, check if the average between sums can result in the value)
